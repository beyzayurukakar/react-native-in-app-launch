________


A React Native library that simplifies the management of essential tasks required before entering a mobile app. It’s designed to handle both synchronous and asynchronous jobs, as well as interdependent tasks that need to be completed in sequence.  

You can ensure that all necessary setup steps — such as data syncing, authorization checks, and configurations are completed smoothly before users proceed.

The library leverages RTK Listener Middleware to efficiently manage task dependencies and execution flow.
